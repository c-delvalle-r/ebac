        "how do we go home?",
        "Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...",
        "I don't know.",
        "We go home with an army.",
        "With Khal Drogo's army.",

        "When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait?",
        "Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.",
        "Why would he say no?",
        "He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.",
        "He'd have to leave home.",
        "He'd have to leave me.",
        "And so would you.",

        "Did I offend you? Sorry.",
        "You are the bastard, though.",
        "Lord Eddard Stark is my father.",
        "And Lady Stark is not your mother,",

        "before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces.",
        "Relax your bow arm.",
        "Let me give you some advice, bastard.",
        "Never forget what you are.",
        "The rest of the world will not.",
        "Wear it like armour...",
        "and it can never be used to hurt you.",
        "What the hell do you know about being a bastard?",
        "All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.",
        "You at a feast...",
        "it's like a bear in a trap.",

        "But he was tough, Ned,",
        "a true ranger.",
        "He was talking madness.",
        "Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.",
        "The two he was with are still missing.",
        "Hmph. A wildling ambush.",
        "Maybe.",
        "Direwolves south of the Wall,",
        "talk of the walkers,",
        "Lord Stark!",
        "and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.",
        "Winter is coming.",
        "Winter is coming.",
        "- Uncle Benjen. - Robb boy.",
        "- How are you? - I'm good.",

        "- Your pardon. - I hear we might be neighbours soon.",
        "- I hope it's true. - Yes, the king has honoured me with his offer.",
        "I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept.",
        "It would be good to have you on the field.",
        "The competition has become a bit stale.",
        "- I don't fight in tournaments. - No?",
        "Getting a little old for it?",
        "I don't fight in tournaments",

        "the sky is blue because we live inside the eye",
        "of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.",
        "Maybe we do.",
        "How do you feel?",
        "You still don't remember anything?",
        "Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times.",
        "In the wind, in the rain...",
        "But you just stood there and watched.",
        "A thousand times.",
        "- You never fall. - I did though.",
        "It's true, isn't it,",
        "what Maester Luwin says about my legs?",
        "I'd rather be dead.",
        "- Don't ever say that. - I'd rather be dead.",
        "Fewer eyes back here, my lady.",
        "But still too many.",
        "It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital.",
        "And no one knew who I was the last time I came, either.",
        "500 men just stood there and watched.",
        "My lady.",
        "Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?",
        "I would. We've done nothing wrong.",
        "We've been instructed to escort you into the city.",
        "Instructed?",
        "I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...",
        "Follow me, Lady Stark.",
        "Cat!",
        "Go on. Go upstairs.",
        "You little worm!",
        "All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms.",
        "You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a...",
        "Pssst!",
        "I meant no disrespect, to you of all people.",
        "How dare you bring me here? Have you lost your mind?",
        "No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what you wanted?",
        "I'm truly sorry... about the locale.",
        "How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?",
        "A dear friend told me.",
        "- Lady Stark. - Lord Varys.",
        "To see you again after so many years is a blessing.",
        "You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?",
        "Your poor hands.",
        "How did you know I was coming?",
        "Knowledge is my trade, my lady.",
        "Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance?",

        "I must admit I do not.",
        "No, Lord Stark.",
        "Well, well, this is an historic day.",
        "Something you don't know that I do.",
        "There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms.",
        "- It's mine. - Yours?",
        "At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.",
        "I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,",
        "as any sane man would.",
        "When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.",

        "Tyrion Lannister.",
        "The honour of your presence is requested.",
        "500 men and this room was silent as a crypt.",

        "I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways",
        "into men of the Night's Watch.",
        "And how's that going, Commander Mormont?",
        "Slowly.",
        "A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.",
        "Good news or bad?",
        "Both.",
        "and the Mad King laughing.",
        "Lord Stark.",
        "I meant... to give you this earlier.",
        "So forgetful these days.",
        "A raven from Winterfell this morning.",
        "Good news?",
        "Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.",
        "- My wife is in Winterfell. - Is she?",
        "Yes, I'm looking at you.",
        "I thought that she'd be safest in here.",
        "One of several such establishments I own.",
        "And later...",
        "You're a funny man.",
        "Huh? A very funny man.",
        "Ned!",
        "Ah, the Starks...",
        "Quick tempers, slow minds.",
        "You broke my nose, bastard!",
        "It's an improvement.",
        "If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit.",
        "I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.",
        "What are you looking at, halfman?",
        "when I watched the Mad King die,",
        "I'm looking at you.",
        "Yes. You've got an interesting face.",
        "Hmm, very distinctive faces.",
        "All of you.",
        "And what do you care about our faces?",
        "It's just...",
        "I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King's Landing.",
        "Perhaps I'll write to my sister, the queen, about it.",
        "We'll talk later, Lord Snow.",
        "Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me.",
        "I remembered him laughing as your father burned...",
        "No one but you.",
        "My father knew and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same.",
        "Grenn's father left him too...",
        "outside a farmhouse, when he was three.",
        "Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.",
        "His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.",
        "He was given a choice - his right hand or the Wall.",
        "I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.",
        "They hate me because I'm better than they are.",
        "It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.",
        "It felt like justice.",
        "I don't imagine any of them had ever held a real sword",
        "before they came here.",
        "Oh...",
        "Your brother Bran.",
        "He's woken up.",
        "The mere suggestion that the queen's brother tried to kill your boy",
        "would be considered treason.",
        "We have proof. We have the blade.",
        "Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him.",
        "The only man who could say otherwise has no throat,",
        "Is that what you tell yourself at night?",
        "thanks to your boy's wolf.",
        "Petyr has promised to help us find the truth.",
        "He's like a little brother to me, Ned. He would never betray my trust.",
        "I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.",
        "A fool's task, admittedly,",
        "but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.",
        "I won't forget this.",
        "You're a true friend.",
        "Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.",
        "- How could you be so stupid? - Calm down.",
        "You're a servant of justice?",
        "He's a child. Ten years old.",
        "- What were you thinking? - I was thinking of us.",
        "You're a bit late to start complaining about it now.",
        "- What has the boy told them? - Nothing. He remembers nothing.",
        "Then what are you raving about?",
        "What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...",
        "We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming.",
        "We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.",
        "- And my husband? - I'll go to war with him if I have to.",
        "They can write a ballad about us -",
        "That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?",
        "\"The War For Cersei's Cunt.\"",
        "- Let me go. - Never.",
        "- Let me go. - The boy won't talk.",
        "And if he does, I'll kill him.",
        "Him, Ned Stark, the king - the whole bloody lot of them,",
        "until you and I are the only people left in this world.",
        "I wish I could see the girls.",
        "- It's too dangerous. - Just for a moment.",
        "Until we know who our enemies are.",
        "I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters.",
        "Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper.",
        "Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back,",
        "In my bones, I know it.",
        "Littlefinger's right.",
        "I can't do anything without proof.",
        "And if you find the proof?",
        "Then I bring it to Robert...",
        "and hope he's still the man I once knew.",
        "You watch yourself on the road, huh?",
        "That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.",
        "My temper?",
        "Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.",
        "would you admire me more?",
        "He still loves you.",
        "Does he?",
        "Off with you.",
        "Yes, it's been a long time.",
        "But I still remember every face.",
        "You remember your first?",
        "Of course, Your Grace.",
        "Who was it?",
        "A Tyroshi.",
        "- Never learned the name. - Hmm.",
        "You served him well... when serving was safe.",
        "How did you do it?",
        "Lance through the heart.",
        "Quick one.",
        "Lucky for you.",
        "Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.",
        "My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud.",
        "He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad,",

        "I knocked him down with the hammer.",
        "Gods, I was strong then.",
        "Lord Stark.",
        "Caved in his breastplate.",
        "Probably shattered every rib he had.",
        "Stood over him, hammer in the air.",
        "Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"Wait! Wait.\"",
        "They never tell you how they all shit themselves.",
        "They don't put that part in the songs.",
        "Stupid boy.",
        "Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.",
        "He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys,",
        "and today his wife would be making him miserable,",
        "Lord Varys.",
        "his sons would be ingrates,",
        "and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.",
        "Wine!",
        "Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name.",
        "Lancel Lannister.",
        "Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "- It's empty, Your Grace. - What do you mean, it's empty?",
        "- There's no more wine. - Is that what empty means?!",
        "So get more.",
        "I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad.",

        "You were only a squire, 16 years old.",
        "You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte.",
        "Best move I ever saw.",
        "A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.",
        "Your outlaw...",
        "any last words?",
        "A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son.",

        "If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices -",
        "pay tribute or fight.",

        "A bit chewy.",
        "And what about you, my lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?",
        "Do Dornish girls count?",
        "So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves",
        "and bring them here as eager recruits?",
        "Aye.",
        "But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.",
        "Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed.",

        "to live on the right side of it.",
        "Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.",
        "You're right.",
        "The wildlings are no different from us.",
        "A little rougher maybe.",
        "But they're made of meat and bone.",

        "It's a blessing from the Great Stallion",

        "I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.",
        "He taught me that speed defeats size.",
        "I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.",

        "Give it here!",
        "What is it?",
        "- I... - Look at its eyes.",

        "And yet you really want to say.",
        "You want to say that?",

        "I should be there.",
        "I should be with him.",
        "If we do that, they'll never get back across.",
        "Well?",
        "What did he say?",
        "Lord Walder has granted your crossing.",
        "- His men are yours, as well. -  Huh.",
        "Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.",
        "What does he want in return?",
        "Another visit?",
        "I could.",

        "I did indeed.",
        "Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me.",

        "take no wives and father no children?",
        "No.",
        "So they will not love.",

        "Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.",
        "Most of us are not so strong.",
        "What is honour...",

        "Go. Now.",
        "- Take her and leave. - Uh-uh.",

        "Ah!",
        "Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?",
        "- Just used to it. - Drink.",
        "Let's play a new game.",
        "There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you.",

        "She swung an axe at me.",
        "You've been north of the Wall.",
        "What brought you up there?",
        "- Work. - And...",
        "you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly",

        "Mm.",
        "You wanted a different life.",
        "and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.",

        "The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.",
        "So, specifics...",
        "You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there?",
        "I don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you.",
        "So... what's a lowborn girl to do?",
        "Drink.",
        "- Are you sure... - Drink!",
        "And don't talk about my mother and father ever,",
        "or I will carve your eyes from your head.",
        "You think my life is some precious thing to me?",
        "My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologise.",

        "Ask away.",
        "Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.",
        "- Who were you in love with? - That's not how the game works.",
        "I don't care the way the game works.",
        "Our lord here used to be married.",
        "- Married? - How did you hear that?",
        "You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.",
        "Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.",
        "That I would trade my honour for a few more years of...",
        "Another night, perhaps.",
        "Not another night. This night.",
        "It's not a pleasant story.",
        "Oh, maybe I will cry.",
        "I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.",
        "So...",
        "I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding, when we heard a scream.",
        "She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.",
        "Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.",
        "She was too scared to send off on her own,",
        "Of what?",
        "so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.",
        "Her name was Tysha.",
        "She was a wheelwright's orphan.",
        "And she was hungry.",
        "Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine.",
        "Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine.",
        "I forgot how afraid I was around girls...",
        "how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or...",
        "look away embarrassed,",
        "or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.",
        "You grew up with actors.",
        "I forgot about everything but Tysha.",
        "And somehow I found myself in her bed.",
        "For three chickens, I should hope so.",
        "It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.",
        "But she was good to me.",
        "She kissed me afterwards and...",
        "sang me a song.",
        "And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.",
        "A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon",
        "and there you have it - man and wife.",
        "You learned their craft and you learnt it well.",
        "For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.",
        "Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.",
        "Not quite.",
        "First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.",
        "The girl was a whore, you see.",
        "Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers... all of it.",
        "He thought it was time I had a woman.",
        "After my brother confessed...",
        "my father brought in my wife",
        "and gave her to his guards.",
        "But I grew up with soldiers.",
        "He paid her well - a silver for each man.",
        "How many whores command that kind of price?",
        "He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.",
        "By the end, she had so much silver",
        "that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.",
        "I would have killed the man who did that to me.",
        "You should have known she was a whore.",
        "Really?",
        "I was 16, drunk and in love.",
        "A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.",
        "I learned how to die a long time ago.",
        "As I said, I was young and stupid.",
